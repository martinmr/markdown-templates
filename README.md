# markdown-templates

A collection of [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
templates for different writing formats. The goal is to provide
examples of how writers can replace
WYSIWYG word processors like Word and Libre Office with markdown which
provides a more portable and practical solution for publishing written
work in any format.

All templates work and render nicely in [Mou](http://mouapp.com/).
